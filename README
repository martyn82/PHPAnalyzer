Static Analysis Tool for PHP

It uses PHP-Parser from Nikic (https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser).
You can install it using the composer.json file and Composer (http://getcomposer.org/).

How to use:

Run the analyze.php script and give it a root directory. It will recursively analyze the .php files in this directory and prints a result considering maintainability attributes. It does the following:
- Gathers all PHP files
- Analyzes the methods/functions in it by:
-- Checking if their size are reasonable and partitions them into small, medium, large, and huge.
-- Checking the cyclomatic complexity by counting execution paths and partitions into risks: low, moderate, high, and very high.
-- Searches the files for duplicated code by detecting clones of at least 6 lines in length.

- Analyzes these metrics by ranking from 1 to 5:
-- The relative amount of LOC for the four risk categories.
-- The relative amount of LOC for the four unit size measures.
-- The relative amount of LOC consisting of duplications.

Rankings:
1 := -- (Very bad)
2 := -  (Bad)
3 := o  (OK/Neutral)
4 := +  (Good)
5 := ++ (Very good)

When done, the output will look like the following:

$ php analyze.php ./src
